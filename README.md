# Randompassword.github.io

For this assingment we were given an html and css file with half of a JS file. We had to file in the rest of the JavaScript file to conmplete a random password generator.

I began by trying to psuedo code what I wanted this to do exactly and follow the outline given by our professor.

I wanted the user to be asked whether he/she would like speficic characters in their password and how long it would be. I also have it alert them the min and max length for a password.

For this project I think I may have come across so many new things while googling and discussing with tutors that I did not fully understand everything I had used, for example the push option in my conditionals.

I was excited to get everything to work even though after some time it only spewed out one character or all of the arrays. I solved that issue and then came across another where it tells me the last ; after the addEventListener is unidentified?

While going through this I have discovered it is also helpful to verbally talk to myself about what is going on, as well as take short breaks. 

I unfortunatley am unable to solve this error however and would greatly apreacite all the feedback.
