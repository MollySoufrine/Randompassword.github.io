# Randompassword.github.io

For this assingment we were given an html and css file with half of a JS file. We had to file in the rest of the JavaScript file to conmplete a random password generator.

I began by trying to psuedo code what I wanted this to do exactly and follow the outline given by our professor.

I wanted the user to be asked whether he/she would like speficic characters in their password and how long it would be. I also have it alert them the min and max length for a password.

For this project I think I may have come across so many new things while googling and discussing with tutors that I did not fully understand everything I had used, for example the push option in my conditionals.

I was excited to get everything to work even though after some time it only spewed out one character or all of the arrays. I solved that issue and then came across another where it tells me the last ; after the addEventListener is unidentified?

While going through this I have discovered it is also helpful to verbally talk to myself about what is going on, as well as take short breaks. While doing this it allowed me to see why I was getting that error and I solved it. However, when generating a password now, i receive an undefined password instead of random characters.

I would appreaciate as much feedback as possible as to why this may be happening.
